<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Fedor ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<h3 align="center">React Developer from Belarus (now in Georgia)</h3>


I'm a Frontend Developer with 2+ years experience.  
Having started my career path with vanilla JavaScript, now I have 1+ year of development experience with React & Next.js.  
I specialize in JavaScript, but looking forward to working with Typescript as well.
